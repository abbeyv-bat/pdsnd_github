## Exploring Bikeshare Data

# Date created
Created by Abbey Vandenberg on January 27th, 2025. 


### About this project: 
The purpose of the project was to explore bikeshare data from multiple U.S. cities. The R code attached was created to explore three questions: 

* How did trip duration vary by gender?
*  Did more females or more males rent bikes in New York City and Chicago?
* What was the most popular time for bikes to be rented? 

# Files used:
A CSV files of data for each of the three cities was used in this project, as well as R version 4.3.1 "Beagle Scouts" and R studio. The CSV files were not included in the repository. 

# Thank you: 
to Udacity for teaching me how to code and explore data for the first time!
